This project proposes ResAttentioNet, a deep learning architecture for emotion recognition from EEG signals. The model integrates a Residual Temporal Feature Extractor (RTFE), Multi-Head Temporal Attention Pooling (MTAP), and an Emotion Discriminative Classifier (EDC) to robustly identify emotional states.The model was trained and tested on the following benchmark datasets:
SEED Dataset ([Emotion classification - 3 classes](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed.html))

SEED-IV Dataset ([4 classes](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-iv.html))

SEED-V Dataset ([5 classes](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-v.html))

SEED-VII Dataset ([7 classes](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-vii.html))
